Python dataclasses for CGMES 3 + rdf schema description + SHACL files

# Content

## Schemas v3

[schemas](./schemas/) are rdf definitions of CGMES. They are used once, to generate dataclasses, and
can then happily be forgotten.

They have been given by Entsoe, via the data office.

Older versions could be found on the [Entsoe site](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/cim/cim-for-grid-models-exchange/).
