    Describes each tap step in the tabular curve.

    b: The magnetizing branch susceptance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual susceptance is
      calculated as follows: calculated magnetizing susceptance = b(nominal) * (1 + b(from this class)/100).
      The b(nominal) is defined as the static magnetizing susceptance on the associated power transformer end or
      ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
    g: The magnetizing branch conductance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual conductance is
      calculated as follows: calculated magnetizing conductance = g(nominal) * (1 + g(from this class)/100).
      The g(nominal) is defined as the static magnetizing conductance on the associated power transformer end or
      ends.  This model assumes the star impedance (pi model) form.
    r: The resistance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual reactance is calculated as follows:
      calculated resistance = r(nominal) * (1 + r(from this class)/100).   The r(nominal) is defined as the
      static resistance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance
      (pi model) form.
    ratio: The voltage at the tap step divided by rated voltage of the transformer end having the tap changer. Hence
      this is a value close to one. For example, if the ratio at step 1 is 1.01, and the rated voltage of the
      transformer end is 110kV, then the voltage obtained by setting the tap changer to step 1 to is 111.1kV.
    step: The tap step.
    x: The series reactance deviation as a percentage of nominal value. The actual reactance is calculated as follows:
      calculated reactance = x(nominal) * (1 + x(from this class)/100).   The x(nominal) is defined as the static
      series reactance on the associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star impedance
      (pi model) form.
