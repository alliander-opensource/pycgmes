    Aggregate induction motor load. This model is used to represent a fraction of an ordinary load as "induction motor
      load".  It allows a load that is treated as an ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be
      represented by an induction motor in dynamic simulation. This model is intended for representation of
      aggregations of many motors dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no
      information on the characteristics of individual motors. Either a "one-cage" or "two-cage" model of the
      induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled. This model treats a fraction of the
      constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set
      equal to Pfrac times the constant P part of the static load.  The remainder of the load is left as a static
      load. The reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at
      the load bus. This reactive power demand can be less than or greater than the constant Q component of the
      load.  If the motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant Q component of the load, the model inserts
      a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant Q
      reactive load.   If an induction motor load model and a static load model are both present for a load, the
      motor Pfrac is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant P load before the static load model is
      applied.  The remainder of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model.
