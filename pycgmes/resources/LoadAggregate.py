    Aggregate loads are used to represent all or part of the real and reactive load from one or more loads in the static
      (power flow) data. This load is usually the aggregation of many individual load devices and the load model is
      an approximate representation of the aggregate response of the load devices to system disturbances. Standard
      aggregate load model comprised of static and/or dynamic components.  A static load model represents the
      sensitivity of the real and reactive power consumed by the load to the amplitude and frequency of the bus
      voltage. A dynamic load model can be used to represent the aggregate response of the motor components of the
      load.
