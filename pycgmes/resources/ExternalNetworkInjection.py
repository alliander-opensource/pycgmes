    """
    This class represents the external network and it is used for IEC 60909 calculations.

    governorSCD: Power Frequency Bias. This is the change in power injection divided by the change in frequency and
      negated.  A positive value of the power frequency bias provides additional power injection upon a
      drop in frequency.
    maxP: Maximum active power of the injection.
    maxQ: Maximum reactive power limit. It is used for modelling of infeed for load flow exchange and not for short
      circuit modelling.
    minP: Minimum active power of the injection.
    minQ: Minimum reactive power limit. It is used for modelling of infeed for load flow exchange and not for short
      circuit modelling.
    ikSecond: Indicates whether initial symmetrical short-circuit current and power have been calculated according to
      IEC (Ik`).  Used only if short circuit calculations are done according to superposition method.
    maxInitialSymShCCurrent: Maximum initial symmetrical short-circuit currents (Ik` max) in A (Ik` = Sk`/(SQRT(3) Un)).
      Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    maxR0ToX0Ratio: Maximum ratio of zero sequence resistance of Network Feeder to its zero sequence reactance
      (R(0)/X(0) max). Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    maxR1ToX1Ratio: Maximum ratio of positive sequence resistance of Network Feeder to its positive sequence reactance
      (R(1)/X(1) max). Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    maxZ0ToZ1Ratio: Maximum ratio of zero sequence impedance to its positive sequence impedance (Z(0)/Z(1) max). Used
      for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    minInitialSymShCCurrent: Minimum initial symmetrical short-circuit currents (Ik` min) in A (Ik` = Sk`/(SQRT(3) Un)).
      Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    minR0ToX0Ratio: Indicates whether initial symmetrical short-circuit current and power have been calculated according
      to IEC (Ik`). Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 6090.
    minR1ToX1Ratio: Minimum ratio of positive sequence resistance of Network Feeder to its positive sequence reactance
      (R(1)/X(1) min). Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    minZ0ToZ1Ratio: Minimum ratio of zero sequence impedance to its positive sequence impedance (Z(0)/Z(1) min). Used
      for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.
    voltageFactor: Voltage factor in pu, which was used to calculate short-circuit current Ik` and power Sk`.  Used only
      if short circuit calculations are done according to superposition method.
    referencePriority: Priority of unit for use as powerflow voltage phase angle reference bus selection. 0 = don t care
      (default) 1 = highest priority. 2 is less than 1 and so on.
    p: Active power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting
      value for steady state solutions.
    q: Reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting
      value for steady state solutions.
