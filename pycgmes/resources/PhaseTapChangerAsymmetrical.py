    Describes the tap model for an asymmetrical phase shifting transformer in which the difference voltage vector adds
      to the in-phase winding. The out-of-phase winding is the transformer end where the tap changer is located.
      The angle between the in-phase and out-of-phase windings is named the winding connection angle. The phase
      shift depends on both the difference voltage magnitude and the winding connection angle.

    windingConnectionAngle: The phase angle between the in-phase winding and the out-of -phase winding used for creating
      phase shift. The out-of-phase winding produces what is known as the difference
      voltage.  Setting this angle to 90 degrees is not the same as a symmetrical
      transformer. The attribute can only be multiples of 30 degrees.  The allowed range is
      -150 degrees to 150 degrees excluding 0.
