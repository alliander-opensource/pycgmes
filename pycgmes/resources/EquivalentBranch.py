    The class represents equivalent branches. In cases where a transformer phase shift is modelled and the
      EquivalentBranch is spanning the same nodes, the impedance quantities for the EquivalentBranch shall consider
      the needed phase shift.

    r: Positive sequence series resistance of the reduced branch.
    r21: Resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1 .Used for steady state power flow. This attribute is
      optional and represent unbalanced network such as off-nominal phase shifter. If only EquivalentBranch.r
      is given, then EquivalentBranch.r21 is assumed equal to EquivalentBranch.r. Usage rule : EquivalentBranch
      is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
    x: Positive sequence series reactance of the reduced branch.
    x21: Reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for steady state power flow. This attribute is
      optional and represents an unbalanced network such as off-nominal phase shifter. If only
      EquivalentBranch.x is given, then EquivalentBranch.x21 is assumed equal to EquivalentBranch.x. Usage
      rule: EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange.
    negativeR12: Negative sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction
      prior to the data exchange.
    negativeR21: Negative sequence series resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction
      prior to the data exchange.
    negativeX12: Negative sequence series reactance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network
      reduction prior to the data exchange.
    negativeX21: Negative sequence series reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage: EquivalentBranch is a result of network
      reduction prior to the data exchange.
    positiveR12: Positive sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2 . Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909.  EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction
      prior to the data exchange.
    positiveR21: Positive sequence series resistance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction
      prior to the data exchange.

      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network
      reduction prior to the data exchange.
    positiveX21: Positive sequence series reactance from terminal sequence 2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short
      circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network
      reduction prior to the data exchange.
    zeroR12: Zero sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit
      data exchange according to IEC 60909. EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior to the
      data exchange.
    zeroR21: Zero sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  2 to terminal sequence 1. Used for short circuit
      data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior
      to the data exchange.
    zeroX12: Zero sequence series reactance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2. Used for short circuit
      data exchange according to IEC 60909. Usage : EquivalentBranch is a result of network reduction prior
      to the data exchange.
